Analyze customer behavior data

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Apply feature selection techniques

Train and evaluate machine learning models

Predict customer churn effectively

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

Key Highlights

Handling missing values and categorical data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for customer insights

Implementation of machine learning models

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab, upload the dataset if required, and run all cells sequentially. No local environment setup is needed.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict customer churn and support data-driven decision-making to improve customer retention.
